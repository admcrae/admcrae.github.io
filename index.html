        I am an assistant professor at the École nationale des ponts et chaussées and a researcher in the <a href="https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr">CERMICS</a> group there.
        Previously, I graduated from Georgia Tech in May 2022 with a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering,
        advised by <a href="https://mdav.ece.gatech.edu">Mark Davenport</a>,
        and from 2022 to 2025 I was a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/optim/">OPTIM</a> lab at EPFL, advised by <a href="https://www.nicolasboumal.net">Nicolas Boumal</a>.

        I am generally interested in the theory of high-dimensional statistics and signal processing and machine learning;
        my current research focuses on the optimization and computational complexity aspects of such problems.
        For many interesting estimation problems, the most natural choice of estimator requires solving a nonconvex or otherwise seemingly intractable optimization problem.
        However, these optimization problems are in practice solved well (even exactly) by convex relaxations or even direct nonconvex approaches
        (see, e.g., my recent work on synchronization problems, which resemble the famous NP-hard max-cut problem).
        I study how the <i>data models</i> from applications influence the difficulty of the associated optimization problems.
        I consider both convex and nonconvex problems and, in particular, the relationship between the two;
        we can often learn a great deal about a nonconvex problem by studying a convex relaxation of it.
